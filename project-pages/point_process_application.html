          <div class="body-text">Point processes are a type of counting process which models ocurrences of an event over time. They have established use-cases in a wide range of fields including epidemiology and queueing theory. More recently, these models have been assessed for their utility in handeling data of extreme values because certain extentsions of the Point Processes do not assume independence between events occurences. Consider the system that gives rise to earthquakes. This is an example of a situation in which the assumption of independence fails, because the aftershocks that follow an initial earthquake can trigger further earthquakes, demonstrating a degree of independence between event occurences. Recently, point processes have shown to be effective in modelling earthquake systems, as well as extreme fluctuations in financial markets. We wanted to explore their use in modeling extreme peaks of carbon dioxide readings. </div>
          <div class="body-text">Our data consisted of CO2 readings from a Savanna site in the Karoo. We investigated simple point processes and two extensions; Hawkes and Marked Hawkes processes. The Hawkes Process is self-exciting which was shown to be helpful in capturing the clusters observed in the data. A Marked Hawkes process includes an additional variable which captures the magnitude of a given event, which may be a helpful indicator as to the likelihood of successive events. We validated our models by examining the observed vs expected counting process, the compensator function, assessing the point process residuals and comparing Q-Q plots.
            Given below are a selection of plots from the project. You can find every plot produced in the <a href="https://github.com/alicethesen/Modelling-extreme-events-using-point-processes/tree/main/All%20Plots" target="_blank">All Plots</a> folder of the <a href="https://github.com/alicethesen/Modelling-extreme-events-using-point-processes" target="_blank">Github Repository</a>.

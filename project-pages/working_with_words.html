I wanted to make a question in which players had to guess the novel based on the year of publication and a wordcloud showing the most frequently words in each book. Luckily, I have the means of doing this without paying for it on a website and I made these word clouds on R. You can find an example of how to produce the plots <a href="https://github.com/alicethesen/aliceweb/blob/main/novelwordclouds.R" target="_blank">here</a>. See if you can guess which books correspond to which word cloud.</div>

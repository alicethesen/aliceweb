          <div class="body-text">For this project, I assessed the efficacy of two types of machine learning grouping algorithms for a dataset of breast cancer cell features. In this dataset, numerous features of cells were recorded along with their classification as either Benign 'B' or Malignant 'M'. The data showed large dimensionality and a significant degree of correlation. To address this, I applied a Principle Component Analysis, followed by a supervised Random Forest Classification model and an unsupervised K-means clustering analysis.</div>
          <div class="body-text">The data was partitioned into training and test datasets, which then had PCA applied to each of them. In some instances, PCA is applied for the purpose of dimension reduction, especially when dealing with computationally expensive methods like random forests. In this instance, the dataset is small enough that dimension reduction is not necessary, but the high correlation of variables within the data set does make a case for PCA. The random forest model produced a classification model with an accuracy of 92%, which is decent considering the relatively small size of the data set. The unsupervised learning method, k-means clustering, produced an accuracy of 91% when compared to the actual diagnoses, which is a great result for an unsupervised learning technique. Given below is a selection of the plots employed to visualise and assess these findings.

The predicted diagnosis is coded by the shape of the point, while the true diagnosis is coded by the colour of the point. The ellipses circle the proposed groupings. Incorrectly classified points are circled in red. As can be seen in the plot, the model has a greater tendency to misclassify benign cells as malignant than the other way around. The random forest model misclassified 9 cells, most commonly the cells with PC1 and PC2 values which put them on the border between the primary groupings.  </span>

The predicted cluster is coded by the shape of the point, while the true diagnosis is coded by the colour of the point. The ellipses circle the predicted clusters and the cluster mean is given by the black asterisk. Incorrectly classified points are circled in red. This plot was produced using the cluster means calculated from the training data and applying these to the test data as a means of checking the efficacy of the model. In this way, we can use a sort of supervised approach to validate our unsupervised model. Obviously, this kind of model check is only possible if the true groupings are known. The k-means cluster analysis only misclassified 11 cells in the test set, 2 more than the random forest. This is an impressive result considering the fact that it is an unsupervised learning process.  </span>
